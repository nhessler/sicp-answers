Exercise 1.13
============

## Question

Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to ```O^n/5^(1/2)```, where ```O = (1 + 5^(1/2))/2```. Hint: Let ```U = (1 - 5^(1/2))/2```. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section 1.2.2) to prove that Fib(n) = (O^n - U^n)/5^(1/2).


## Answer

I don't have an answer for this question. In regard to the math questions such as these I will not be answering them. Instead, I'll just read the Solutions and paste some notes from them.


## Notes

I read through 3 of the proofs. They all proved the second statement first using induction. There was a bit of extra info used around the properties of the golden ratio.
