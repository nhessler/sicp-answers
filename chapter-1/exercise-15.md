Exercise 1.15
============

## Question

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sin x is around x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity


to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered ``sufficiently small'' if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a.  How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

b.  What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?


## Answer

**a.**
```scheme
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine 4.05))
(p (p (sine 1.35)))
(p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
(p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))
```
6 times

**b.**
```
radians | processes
    1   |     3
    3   |     4
    9   |     5
   25   |     6
   73   |     7
  219   |     8
  657   |     9
```
it's not quite right bout it appears that space and time grow at about the cube root of n


## Notes

Solutions seem to point at a log(x) growth of time and space. Also, they don't count the first invocation of sine so they only count 5 invocations.
