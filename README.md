## Description

These are my answers to the exercises in the book 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs'. The answers are my own, and I will be checking them against http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions.

Each exercise is broken down into its own file. The exercise file will be located in a folder of the chapter it came from. Each file will contain the question and the answer in a markdown file. (e.g Exercise 1.1 is located at chapter-1/exercise-1.md)
